# Ohana

Ohana is a platform that helps connect high school students to college students from the same high school or city.

It's hard to know what a school is like, even if you visit it. The best way is to hear about it from a 
student currently attending the school, especially if they have a similar background to you.

Students from the same high school or city are also more likely to talk to and help each other because of that level of connection.

Ohana means family, and family means nobody gets left behind.

## Goals
Ohana hopes to help answer some questions most high school students have regarding college applications and deciding where to go:
1) Where should I apply? What schools are best for what I want to study? Where do I want to be?
2) How do I best approach my application for a particuar school? What do they look for? 
3) What is the school like? The academics, location, everyday life.
4) Are there peope I know there? Is there a community of people from home there?
